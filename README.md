FM_Coach
========

Application to help Football Manger players to evalaute coach star rating.


Data come froms FM Scout web site:
http://www.fmscout.com/i-1176-5-stars-training-in-Football-Manager-2011.html

Disclaimer: I did not decompiled Football Manager source code to get star rating formula. FM_Coach does not require Football Manager database import, link or extract to work. The player set the ratings himself in the software to get an approximate star rating evaluation (as close as possible to the real one).
