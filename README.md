Disclaimer:
- No hacking or reverse ingineering has been used to make this software:
  - I did not decompiled Football Manager source code to get star rating formula.
  - I did not used debugger to get star rating formula.
- FM_Coach does not require Football Manager program or database import, link or extract to work. The player set the ratings himself in the software to get an approximate star rating evaluation (as close as possible to the real one).
- FM_Coach does not even require Football Manager to be installed on the computer to work
